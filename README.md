Tic Tac Toe game with playable AI. Includes minimax algorithm for AI decision making.
### What is this?  
This repo features a playable Tic Tac Toe game against an unbeatable AI opponent. The best possible outcome against the computer is a Tie! Don't believe me? Try to beat my AI by running the python script.

### Why did I make this?
I wanted to practice learning a new algorithm that I did not learn in university. I used a min-max algorithm for the AI's decision making. But mainly, this was made for fun.


## Overview
To play, simply run the python script in your terminal. You will be greated by an ASCII version of the Tic Tac Toe game. From here, simply select the squares you want to place your 'X' in.
